# Notes

## Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev # runs api and app concurrently
```

## Overview

The stackblitz I forked wouldn't let me use the termnial so I create a new vite react project and copied the instructions and other relevent bits over.

While this is built in a single app, I wrote the front-end and back-end code as if they were completely separate, hopefully getting at what the heart of what the challenge is about.

### Backend

I wrote a simple express-based api that runs alongside the front end app. This backend reads and writes from Prisma. I felt comfortable using an ORM as I believe one is used internally to Tava.

### Front-End

- Tailwind: Quickest way to build the UI.
- Tanstack Query: React data fetching library with built in local caching.
- Tanstack Table: Lightweight table library with a lot of flexibility.
- React Hook Form: Form library with easy validation.

One gotcha is that my current employee list view name filter is only talks to the list of all employees. I did setup the api and the query to be able to filter but didn't implement it on the front end for the sake of time and data caches means that I can filter without refetching.

### Checklist

- [x] List View
  - [x] The employees are in a flat array from the API, but they need to be grouped by department in the list view.
  - [x] The yellow background color in the list mockup represents the hover state for each row.
  - [x] No detail view is required; route directly to an edit view.
- [x] Edit View
  - [x] Implement an editable form for employee details based on the data structure.
- [x] Navigation
  - [x] Finish styling the navigation bar and add a routeable item for **Employees**.
- [x] Filtering
  - [x] Add a text input filter to search employees by name or other key fields.
  - [x] Employees should remain grouped by department as the list filters.
  - [ ] If all employees in a department are filtered out, that department should be removed from the list view.
    > I went a slightly different ux direction here.
- [x] Styling
  - [x] Use the `src/styles.css` file to write raw CSS, brought in tailwind and a component library.
- [x] Type Definitions
  - [x] Use the `src/types.ts` file to define types for your API.
  - [x] Youâ€™ll need an interface for the **Employee** and types for each CRUD action implemented in the API.

## Bonus

- [x] Additional API Functionality - Implement `create` and `delete` methods.

- [ ] Enriched Data - Expand the data file with additional details for each employee to create a more comprehensive and engaging UI experience.

- [x] Unit and Integration Tests - Add tests to cover key components and API methods.

- [ ] Sorting - Allow sorting of employees by name or department.

- [x] Responsiveness - Make the UI responsive for mobile and tablet views.

- [x] Data Persistence - Store data persistently (e.g., local storage or in-memory database).

- [x] Error Handling and User Feedback - Implement user-friendly error messages and loading states.

- [x] Advanced Filtering - Allow filtering by multiple fields like department or status.

- [x] Dark Mode - Add a toggle for dark mode to showcase design flexibility.
